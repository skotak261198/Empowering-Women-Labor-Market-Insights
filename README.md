# Women's Global Labor Market

## Women in the Global Labor Force

Women remain significantly underrepresented in the global labor market, with only about 50% of women working or actively seeking employment compared to 80% of men. This disparity is not just a matter of equity, but also one of economic efficiency.

To address this critical issue, the United Nations has outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals, three of which are directly related to gender and economic equality:

- **Goal 5:** Gender Equality
- **Goal 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth
- **Goal 10:** Reduced Inequalities

As part of the UN's gender-focused initiatives, the Equality Data Investigative Unit has been tasked with exploring the roots of these disparities, identifying which countries are most affected, and uncovering the underlying causes. Our project builds upon the influential work of **Claudia Goldin**, the 2023 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, whose research, including the well-known **U-Curve** of women’s labor force participation, provides a foundational understanding of these gender gaps.

### Project Objectives

Our project seeks to answer several key questions that are crucial to understanding and addressing gender disparities in the labor market:

- **What are the global trends in the gender gap in labor participation rates?**  
  Understanding these trends will serve as a baseline for further analysis.

- **Why do gender gaps in labor participation persist worldwide?**  
  Contrary to the expectation that economic growth and educational access would reduce gender disparities, these gaps remain pervasive. Our analysis aims to validate or challenge this assumption.

- **What explains the variation in gender gaps across time and continents?**  
  With diverse cultures and economic environments around the world, understanding localized factors is essential for accurate and actionable insights.

### Summary

Addressing these questions is vital for global economic prosperity. Inefficient labor allocation, where individuals are not matched with jobs suited to their skills—or are excluded from the workforce altogether—results in significant economic losses. By reducing the gender gap in employment and better utilizing female talent, we could see substantial gains in global GDP.

## Dataset Description

This analysis uses data from the World Bank Gender Data Portal, provided in a comprehensive dataset with 305,545 rows and 57 columns. The dataset covers 1,153 variables across 265 countries and regions, organized chronologically from 1991 to 2021. For analysis, the dataset has been expanded to over 38 million rows when converted to long format, allowing for in-depth longitudinal and continental comparisons.

### Disclaimer on Gender Representation

Our research follows Claudia Goldin's framework and the binary gender data provided by the World Bank, focusing on male and female classifications. While this analysis operates within a binary context, we recognize and respect the broader spectrum of gender identities and the importance of a more inclusive approach to gender equality.

### Emphasis on Data Analysis

This project prioritizes data analysis over data processing, aiming to extract meaningful insights from a complex, multi-dimensional dataset. Our focus is on uncovering the root causes of gender gaps in labor participation and providing actionable insights that can drive meaningful change. The depth and sophistication of our analysis underscore the importance of data-driven solutions in addressing global challenges.
